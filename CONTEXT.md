# FishEye project

First of all I'll explain what this context file is all about. <br />
For a year and two month I've been in a formation from OpenClassrooms to become a `JS` and `React` developper. <br />
In this formation every single project is made with a story that you could encounter during your developper life. <br />
I will use the context file to explain my role in the project and what I was supposed to do. <br />
Every repo with a `PXX_ProjectName_LastName_FirstName` is a repo of a project realised during my formation with OpenClassrooms. <br />
Now that this is said let's talk about the project. <br />

## The project

Together with your project manager Amanda and the UI Designer, you have just had a project kick-off meeting with a new client, FishEye. FishEye is a website that allows freelance photographers to showcase their best work. They have recently raised some funds and would like to update their website.

### My role

For a few weeks now, you have been a junior developer at Techasite, a consulting firm specialising in website and mobile application development.

For this project I got a model, some meeting notes, images and videos, some data in JSON and the code base of the project. Most of the CSS and HTML was already done I had to focus on JavaScript. <br />

I needed to use JSON data to make the content of the app dynamic, I had to create a carousel for the medias and the project was heavily focused on accessibility so the whole app needed to be usable with a keyboard and a screen reader.
